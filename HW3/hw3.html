    <h1>Homework 3: Github page (World Projection Maps)</h1>
    <h3 style="color: red;">To display the world map in all of the different projections below, I imported the provided shapefile to QGIS, and in the lower right corner, changed the projections to my liking. I 
        then downloaded and installed the indicatrix mapper, and then clicked on the indicatrix icon on the top bar and enabled it, which created a layer of lined circles at different 
        latitudes on the map to show the relative size of that specific latitude. After getting this layer, I formatted the map with descriptive text and then uploaded it to my local files as a 
        png file.

<!--WGS84-->
<h2>WGS84</h2>
<p>WGS84 stretches areas near to the poles and increases their relative size in order to allow for grid-like coordinates. In order to ensure that landmasses <br>
    at extreme latitudes don't become too big, they are then squished so as to minimize the size increase in the eyes of the viewer.</p>

<!--Aitoff-->
<h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
<p>The Aitoff projection is an oval projection, abandoning the grid system of coordinates. It is better at preserving size than WGS84 but can cause <br>
    landmasses towards the edge of the projection to become distorted. An example of this can be seen in Canada and Alaska. This issue is somewhat <br>
    solved since most of the area towards the edges of the map are ocean.</p>

<!--Pseudo-Mercator-->
<h2>Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
<p>Pseudo-Mercator Projection projects the spherical contents of the globe onto an unrolled cylindrical surface in order to preserve a grid-like layout.<br>
    this causes areas near the poles to be expanded in size relative to their actual size, while keeping areas close to the equator to maintian their size. </p>

<!--Winkel 1-->
<h2>Winkel I</h2>
<p>Winkel 1 consists of two straight lines, the Equator and the Prime Meridian. All other meridians are curved away from the Prime. While still <br>
    causing expansion at the poles, it is not as defined as others such as Mercator. There is significant bulging towards the equator but this is remedied <br>
    by the fact that this distorsion is mainly caused over ocean. </p>

<!--Cylindrical Equal-Area-->
<h2>Cylindrical Equal-Area Projection</h2>
<p>The Cylindrical Equal-Area Projection maintains a rectangular shape and square coordinates and also maintains relative areas on a map. This is <br>
    achieved by stretching areas closer to the poles to match the size of the equator. Areas remain the size they should be but their appearence is distorted. </p>

<!--Equidistant conic projection-->
<h2>Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
<p>Equidistant Conic Projections involve a concentric circle and arc pair acting as the bounds for straight lines of longitude that meet at the North pole and <br>diverge at the South. This creates a conical shape. Shape is distorted and areas further out from the center are larger. </p>

<!--Azimuthal equidistant-->
<h2>Azimuthal Equidistant Projection</h2>
<p>Azimuthal Equidistant Projection consist of straight longitudinal lines projecting from a center point. The areas of the earth furthest away from the center <br>
    point are heavily distorted while areas closer retain scale as well as distance. Along latitudes the scale, distance, and distorsion are not relevant but when <br>
    compared to areas of different longitudes it becomes a problem. This map generally works when the scale of areas furthest from the center doesn't <br>
    matter (oceans/ Antarctica).</p>
