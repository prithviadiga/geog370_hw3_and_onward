            <abstract>The Mountain Ridge Protection Act (MRPA) of 1983 established protections in the form of building height restrictions for ridgelines at or above 3,000 feet in elevation and/or that rise 500 feet or more above their adjacent valley floor. This dataset identifies, via vector line data, the ridges which meet those criteria, as initially determined on a series of hand-annotated United States Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps and later digitized into this vector line dataset. The data will not be updated except in the event of an amendment to the MRPA of 1983.Text of the MRPA of 1983 (North Carolina General Statute Chapter 113A, Article 14) is available at https://www.ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_113A/Article_14.pdf.</abstract>

                    <udom>YELLOW - identifies a ridge for protection because it has an elevation of 3,000 or more feet and it rises 500 feet or more above the valley floor.
ORANGE - indicates that a ridge identified for protection with an elevation of 3,000 feet or higher also forms the common boundary between two counties.
GREEN - identifies a ridge or a part of a ridge rising 500 feet or more above the valley floor, but having an elevation of less than the 3,000 or more feet defining primary eligibility for protection in the Act.
BLUE - indicates that a ridge identified for protection rising 500 feet or more above the valley floor, but having less than 3,000 foot elevation, also forms the common boundary between two counties.

It is important to note that the ridge identification lines are only for the purpose of identifying ridges to be protected. They are in no way meant to show the extent of the 100 foot elevation protection zone specified by the Act.

The degree and kind of protection to which ridges identified for protection are subject is dependent upon which options available under the Act are chosen by the local government units having jurisdiction. For that reason, if ridges rising 500 feet or more above the valley floor, but with less than 3,000 foot elevation, have been identified in this data, their actual protection under the Act is entirely dependent on whether or not the local government with jurisdiction has elected to remove the Act's 3,000 foot elevation requirement. Local government authorities should be consulted to determine applicable ridge protection when interpreting this data.</udom>
