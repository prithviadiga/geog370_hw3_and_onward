    <h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing Analysis</h1>
    <p>This map has two original vector layers that I altered with geoprocessing techniques (Dissolve and Intersection) along with a third unaltered base layer showing <br>
    an outline of NC and its counties. The layers to be altered are Game Land in North Carolina and National Conservation sites in North Carolina. I chose these layers because I wanted <br> 
    my project to relate to conservation. I noticed that there was overlap between the two layers, which was difficult to understand since one is for hunting and fishing, while <br>
    the other is dedicated to preserving the land and its biodiversity. The first thing I did was create an intersection layer between Game Land and Conservation using geoprocessing <br>
    in order to visualize the overlap. My plan was to find the areas of the intersection and of the entire conservation area layer and divide them, to find the percentage of national <br>
    conservation land that is at risk of poaching by hunters. I dissolved both of these layers so that it would be easier to find their area using the field calculator in their attribute <br>
    tables. The default area unit was in meters square, but since I wasn't dividng by hand and was ultimately looking for a percentage, I didn't see an issue with it. I did have to change <br>
    data type from a 32 bit integer to a 64 bit integer since the highest value a 32 bit integer can store is 2^32 which is roughly 4 billion. The overall conservation area amounts to exactly <br>
    12,559,056,356 meters squared, or 12,559.06 square kilometers. The area of the intersection of Game Land and Conservation Areas amounts to exactly 3,118,180,349 meters squared, or 3118.2 square <br>
    kilometers. When the intersection is divided by the total conservation area, the result shows that 24.83% of conservation land in North Carolina is also designated as game land. With so many small <br>
    polygon shapes present, the map looked very cluttered, so for cosmetic purposes I dissolved the base map to remove the county boundaries which were ultimately unecessary for conveying useful information.</p>
