    <h1>Homework 6pt2: Census data ratios and categories</h1>
    <h2>Prithvi Adiga</h2>
    <h4>Since I'd used a ratio for part 1, I used commute data for a different state (New York) and found the ratio of people who commuted over 45 minutes daily to the total number of commuters. <br>
        The data I was using had a column for the total number of commuters and then columns on 5 minute intervals until it reached 45 minutes, upon which it was 45-59, 60-89, and then 90+ minute commutes.<br>
        After cleaning and joining the CSV to my NY State Shapefile, I created a new field that added upp all the fields of 45+ minutes and then divided them by the total. I then used symbology to set them to <br>
        3 different modes of data classification listed below. One of the counties, Hamilton, with a population of 5,000 had no data and so I created a second layer that used a single symbol gray fill in order to <br>
        make Hamilton county appear to be gray as well as creating a null entry in the legend. I created the ratio I did because in a dense state like New York, I wanted to see the percent of people with long commutes.<br>

    <h2>New York Choropleth Maps:</h2>

    <p>This map uses the Equal-Count (quantiles) mode of data classification. Equal-count ensures that each colored category of the choropleth is represented an equal number of times. <br>
    This is good if data is clumped together, but in the case of extreme outliers can end up categorizing drastically different outcomes together. In this map, the percent counts are split<br>
    between 0-9-14-20-32-51, radiating from lightest to darkest as they get closer to New York City. This makes it easy to read the map as well as making it aesthetically appealing. The issue <br>
    with this map specifically is that the darkest color is 23-52%, which is a large difference and doesn't allow room for nuance. <br>

    <p>This map uses the Equal-Interval mode of data classification. Equal-Interval ensures that each colored category contains the same number range. This is very good in a data-set where <br>
    individual items are evenly distributed, but in a map with strict rural and urban boundaries the upper outliers can raise the mean. Furthermore, with there being so many rural <br>
    counties, the mode is very low. This causes equal-interval maps detailing numbers relating to urban and rural areas to have a majority of divisions in the first category with only the largest<br>
    cities occupying the remaining categories. These maps are useful at evenly representing all data on a linear scale in cases where outliers are either not present or ignored. In a state such as New York <br>
    that is more densely populated, there are more darkly colored counties than would be normally, but most of the northern counties remain the lightest color.

    <p>This map uses the Natural Breaks mode of data classification. Natural-Breaks does not follow any strict rules, but instead is algorithmically designed to maximize differences between categories <br>
    while minimizing the differences present within a category. It's great for datasets with variations and the presence of significant outliers, but it is also very subjective as well as not being visually intuitive<br>
    as the other categorization methods are. Because it is algorithmic and not based on simple category breaks, it can be computationally intensive when used on large datasets. When used on New York State, it appears to be <br>
    a middle ground between equal intervals and equal count. It does what Equal-Count does but includes less space in the top interval, which makes it more representative of what the data actually says.
