    <h1>Homework 6pt2: Census data ratios and categories</h1>
    <h2>Prithvi Adiga</h2>
    <h4>I used the data from part 1 which contained commute data for every county in Virginia in 3 columns: total number of commuters, number of commuters who commute <br>
    less than 15 minutes, and a custom value I created myself, the percent of commuters who commute less than 15 minutes. Since I'd used the percentage value for my <br>
    last map, for this map I used population of people who commuted less than 15 minutes as my ratio and then I projected it with three different modes of data visualization:
        <ul>
            <li>Equal Count (Quantiles)</li>
            <li>Equal Interval</li>
            <li>Natural Breaks</li>
        </ul>
    </h4>
    <h2>Maps:</h2>
    <p>This map uses the Equal-Count (quantiles) mode of data classification. Equal-count ensures that each colored category of the choropleth is represented an equal number of times. <br>
    This is good if data is clumped together, but in the case of extreme outliers can end up categorizing drastically different outcomes together. While this map has a lot of darker <br>
    areas, because the high is 75,000 commuters and dark green is anything greater than 8,000, it doesn't accurately convey the differences in the pieces of data contained in that category.<br>
    Despite these issues, the map is easy to read because of the equal distribution in colors and is also visually appealing.</p>

    <p>This map uses the Equal-Interval mode of data classification. Equal-Interval ensures that each colored category contains the same number range. This is very good in a data-set where <br>
    individual items are evenly distributed, but in a map with strict rural and urban boundaries the upper outliers can raise the mean. Furthermore, with there being so many rural <br>
    areas, the mode is very low. This causes equal-interval maps detailing numbers relating to urban and rural areas to have a majority of divisions in the first category with only the largest<br>
    cities occupying the remaining categories. These maps are useful at evenly representing all data on a linear scale in cases where outliers are either not present or ignored. </p>

    <p>This map uses the Natural Breaks mode of data classification. Natural-Breaks does not follow any strict rules, but instead is algorithmically designed to maximize differences between categories <br>
    while minimizing the differences present within a category. It's great for datasets with variations and the presence of significant outliers, but it is also very subjective as well as not being visually intuitive<br>
    as the other categorization methods are. Because it is algorithmic and not based on simple category breaks, it can be computationally intensive when used on large datasets. </p>
